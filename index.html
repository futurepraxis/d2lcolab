      <p>D2L coLab is an app designed to allow students to communicate about group projects. The app is intended to help in-class and online students collaborate on assignments. The app will integrate with the D2L (Desire to Learn) learning-management system, which is used by universities nationwide. The app gives students the ability to set up video meetings with classmates, participate in online chat sessions, have easy access to assignments from instructors, collaborate on shared documents, and assist with project management by allowing students to create and assign tasks to other team members and manage a team calendar. The app is available on both desktop and mobile in order to meet students where they are.</p>
      <h3>Project Goals</h3>
<ul>
      <li>Create an effective way for students  to communicate with other students in their classes</li>
      <li>Ability to have video calls through the app</li>
      <li>Create a way to facilitate group work through the app</li>
      <li>Provide a way to add group tasks in the in-app calendar</li>
      <li>Give ability to prioritize assigned work from class and assigned group tasks</li>
      <li>Ability to add users’ availability schedule to the in-app calendar</li>
      <li>Provide a checklist of assignments and tasks to help keep track of what needs to be done</li>
      <li>Facilitate the interactions between in-class students of DePaul university with their online counterparts</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Design Tenets</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make it easy to access the features needed by the user</li>
  <li>Make the number to steps needed to achieve a goal minimal </li>
  <li>Users should be able to gather information on a page with a glance</li>
  <li>Make it easy to collaborate, communicate, and coordinate.</li>
</ul>

          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <h3>Personas</h3>
          <p>Once we realized our app idea and the goals we wanted to achieve through the app, we created the personas to get a better idea of the type of users we want to build the app for. As we wanted this app to be used in conjunction with the existing D2L website, both of our personas will be DePaul University students.</p>
          <h4>Izzy</h4>
          <p><em>In-class student. 30's. Works full-time.</em></p>
          <p>Izzy is a graduate student in the HCI master’s program at DePaul University. She is in
            her mid-thirties, works full-time in downtown Chicago, and attends classes in-person. She chose
            DePaul’s program because the downtown location makes it convenient for her to attend classes
            after work. Even though she enjoys her classes, working on group projects can be difficult. She
            spends her weekends with her family and catching up on homework, so it can be difficult to
            schedule meetings with other students, especially online students. Since Izzy is so busy with
            work and family, she finds it hard to find time to stay on top of the email, D2L notifications, and
            Slack notifications (which is often used to work on group projects with online students).</p>
            <h4>Olivia</h4>
            <p><em>Online student. 20's. Freelancer.</em></p>
            <p>Olivia is a graduate student in the HCI master’s program at DePaul University. She is in
              her late twenties and works as a freelance graphic designer. Even though she lives on the East
              Coast, she chose DePaul’s program because it has a great reputation and is also offered
              completely online. Olivia enjoys her classes, however, she sometimes finds it difficult to
              participate in group projects due to scheduling issues and the lack of facetime with in-class
              students. She also finds that her flexible freelance schedule and the time difference makes it
              difficult to connect on projects, since most students seem to work full-time and be on Central
              time zone.</p>
